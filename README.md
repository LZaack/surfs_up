# Surfs Up Analysis
## Overview

W. Avy asked me for more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results

In the following image is a table in which I compare Oahu´s temperature results in the months of June and December between 2010 and 2017.
